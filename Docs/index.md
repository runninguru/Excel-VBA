# What is this code?

It's all VBA, designed to be used in Microsoft Excel. It is a collection of scripts I have find useful for a variety of purposes: basically any time I feel the need to create a VBA script, I find myself using one or more of these. Many of them are used for some kind of data validation.

# How this code is meant to be used

Currently, all of the code here is designed to be used directly in VBA scripts, including the functions... as opposed to VBA functions designed to be called directly from an Excel spreadsheet. I haven't added any of those yet. Most of this code is designed to be used in spreadsheets created with column headers which uniquely identify data in each column.

These scripts were designed to be used with data oriented in such a manner that columns represent properties of data and rows represent individual pieces of data. If the data in your spreadsheets is transposed, some of these scripts will not work.
